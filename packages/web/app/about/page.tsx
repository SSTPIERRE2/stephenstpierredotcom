            Thanks for visiting my digital space! I'm Stephen, the human behind
            the coding content you'll find here. I'm 30 years old and started
            making websites when I was 17, starting with plain old HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript. These days I primarily build web applications with
            TypeScript, React.js, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, but am
            constantly experimenting with cutting-edge technologies like
            Next.js, Serverless, and GraphQL. Continue on to view my full tech
            stack and resume below!

        <p>
          I'll be honest I'm not a prodigy who was introduced to coding at a
          young age, really the first time I touched code was in high school by
          a stroke of luck. In my junior year of high school there happened to
          be a general multimedia class which involved basic web development
          with HTML and CSS, and editing images and videos. Programming classes
          weren't common in high schools at the time, and even when I made it to
          college to study Computer Science Java was the first language they
          taught, until soon Python took over as the more approachable
          object-oriented language for teaching beginners. Furthermore, my
          college lacked specific web development classes where my only option
          was a single elective where I got into more advanced web technologies
          including JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node.js, and Heroku.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.heading}>
          All of this is to say that getting into web development is different
          for everyone depending on your background, and for some like me the
          path was ill-defined. Most of what I've learned about web development
          has come from official documentation like{' '}
          <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDN">MDN Web Docs</Link> ,{' '}
          <Link href="https://react.dev/">react.dev</Link>, online courses and
          resources from{' '}
          <Link href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</Link>,{' '}
          <Link href="https://zerotomastery.io/">Zero to Mastery</Link>,{' '}
          <Link href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/">Josh W Comeau</Link>, and
          more. It's very much a "you get out what you put in" type industry
          where techniques and technologies are constantly evolving which is
          what makes it so exciting to be immersed in.
