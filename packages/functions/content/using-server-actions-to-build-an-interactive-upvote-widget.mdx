[Server actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) are a brand new, cutting-edge React feature only usable in frameworks that support it like Next.js. Next.js defines them asynchronous functions that are executed on the server, while the [React documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server) defines them as server-side functions that can be called from client-side code.
